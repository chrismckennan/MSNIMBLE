Description: Performs differential abundance factor analysis, and mtGWAS in metabolomic data with non-random missing observations and latent factors. The main functions are "Num.Instruments" to determine the number of instruments to estimate missingness mechanisms; "EstimateMissing" to estimate missingness mechanisms; "DiffAbundance" to perform differential abundance analyses; "mtGWAS" to perform an mtGWAS.
